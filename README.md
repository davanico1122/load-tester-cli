 Manual Build
Prerequisites

Node.js â‰¥ 14.0.0
npm or yarn

Build Steps
bash# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install pkg globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g pkg

# Build for specific platform
pkg . --targets=node18-win-x64 --out-path=dist          # Windows
pkg . --targets=node18-macos-x64 --out-path=dist        # macOS
pkg . --targets=node18-linux-x64 --out-path=dist        # Linux

# Build for all platforms
npm run build-all
Available Build Targets

node18-win-x64 - Windows 64-bit
node18-macos-x64 - macOS 64-bit
node18-linux-x64 - Linux 64-bit
node18-macos-arm64 - macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2)
node18-linux-arm64 - Linux ARM64

 Limitations and Safety
System Limitations

Maximum VUs: 10,000 (to prevent system overload)
Maximum Total Requests: 1,000,000 per session
Request Timeout: 10 seconds
Inter-request Delay: 50ms (to prevent spam)

Security and Ethics

 DO NOT use to attack other people's websites
 Use only for testing your own websites/APIs
 Ensure you have permission to perform load testing
 Start with small VUs and increase gradually

 Troubleshooting
Error: "ECONNREFUSED"
bash Error: connect ECONNREFUSED
Solution:

Ensure URL is correct and server is running
Check if firewall is blocking the connection

Error: "Maximum call stack size exceeded"
bash Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded
Solution:

Reduce number of VUs or requests per VU
Ensure system has sufficient RAM

Error: "EMFILE: too many open files"
bash Error: EMFILE: too many open files
Solution:

Reduce number of VUs
Increase system file descriptor limit:
bash# Linux/macOS
ulimit -n 65536


Load Test Slow/Hanging
Solution:

Check internet connection
Reduce number of VUs
Ensure target server can handle the load

 Optimization Tips
1. Determining Optimal VUs
bash# Start small
load-tester --url https://example.com --vus 10 --duration 10

# Increase gradually
load-tester --url https://example.com --vus 50 --duration 30
load-tester --url https://example.com --vus 100 --duration 60
2. Testing Strategy

Smoke Test: 1-10 VUs, 1-5 minutes
Load Test: 10-100 VUs, 5-15 minutes
Stress Test: 100-1000 VUs, 15-30 minutes
Spike Test: Dramatically increase/decrease VUs

3. Monitoring System Resources

Monitor CPU, RAM, and Network on target server
Use tools like htop, netstat, or monitoring tools

 Load Testing Best Practices
Planning Your Tests

Define Objectives

What are you trying to measure?
What's your expected baseline performance?
What's your performance target?


Environment Preparation

Use dedicated test environment
Ensure consistent network conditions
Disable unnecessary services


Test Scenarios
bash# Baseline test
load-tester --url https://api.example.com --vus 1 --duration 60

# Normal load
load-tester --url https://api.example.com --vus 50 --duration 300

# Peak load
load-tester --url https://api.example.com --vus 200 --duration 600

# Stress test
load-tester --url https://api.example.com --vus 1000 --duration 300

Common Performance Issues

High Response Times

Database bottlenecks
Insufficient server resources
Network latency


Low Success Rate

Server errors (5xx)
Timeouts
Connection limits


Inconsistent Performance

Memory leaks
Garbage collection issues
Resource contention



 Advanced Usage
Testing Different HTTP Methods
The tool currently supports GET requests. For testing other methods, you can modify the source code or use it in combination with other tools.
Custom Headers and Authentication
For APIs requiring authentication, consider:

Using a reverse proxy
Implementing token-based auth in the target endpoint
Modifying the source code to include custom headers

Integration with CI/CD
bash# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Load Test
  run: |
    ./load-tester-cli --url ${{ env.API_URL }} --vus 100 --duration 60
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then exit 1; fi

Be aware of rate limiting and terms of service
Monitor resource usage on both client and server
Consider impact on other users/services

Legal Compliance

Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
Respect website terms of service
Consider GDPR and data protection requirements
Document your testing authorization

FAQ
Q: Can I test HTTPS websites?
A: Yes, the tool supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
Q: What's the difference between VUs and requests?
A: VUs (Virtual Users) simulate concurrent users. Each VU sends multiple requests during the test duration.
Q: Can I test APIs with authentication?
A: Currently, the tool supports basic GET requests. For authenticated APIs, consider using a proxy or modifying the source code.
Q: Is this tool suitable for production testing?
A: Yes, but always test responsibly and ensure you have proper authorization.

Happy Load Testing!
